An application to showcase recent projects I have developed and contributed to. This application utilizes [React](https://react.dev/) and is deployed on [Netlify](https://netlify.com).

    - A link to the GitHub repository 
- A contact form to reach out to me
- A copy of my resume that can be downloaded locally
- Links to my GitHub page, my LinkedIn page, and a link to published papers on PubMed
- A professional headshot
- A scroll-able navigation bar composed of tabs
